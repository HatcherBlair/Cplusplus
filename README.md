# Sumarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project took a list of purchases from a store and put them into a list containing each item once and their frequency.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job of implementing my python and combining the two languages.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient?
I could enhance my code when dealing with the files, I could not figure out how to store the information from the file somewhere where multiple functions could acess it and so I read from the file everytime I needed that information

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I had a lot of difficulty writing the code to read from the file and sort the data, in order to overcome this I wrote several versions and went line by line until I had something I liked

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Combining multiple languages will be the best skill I gained from this project, in the real world every program has several languages that all interact with eachother because they are all designed for different purposes and so that skill will cary on in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program very modular and broke everything into functions, used proper whitespace, and used descriptive inline comments in order to create readable code that can be maintained in the future.
